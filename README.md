<h2>Overview of Core Gameplay</h2>
<p>
  A strategic, fast-paced, 4-player deathmatch where players take on the role of spies in a high-stakes race to secure keycards and escape. Each match is a thrilling blend of stealth, speed, and strategy. Players must navigate through rooms filled with potential dangers, including traps set by their opponents, while racing against the clock to collect keycards hidden within interactable objects.
</p>
<p>
  The core mechanics include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Keycard Collection:</strong> Search rooms and loot furniture to find the keycards necessary to unlock the final door.</li>
  <li><strong>Trap Placement:</strong> Set traps to incapacitate opponents, preventing them from reaching keycards or escaping.</li>
  <li><strong>Movement and Evasion:</strong> Move quickly and carefully through the environment, avoiding traps and outmaneuvering rivals.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Escape:</strong> Use the collected keycards to unlock the final door and secure your escape before time runs out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>
Project Lazarus is a full-scale version of the original Lay-Off game, a strategic multiplayer experience where players navigate through corporate office environments filled with traps and hazards. Your mission is to outsmart opponents by gathering key resources and utilizing a variety of tools to escape or sabotage others, all while managing energy and avoiding deadly traps.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gameplay Implementation:</strong> Developed the core gameplay mechanics, including the keycard collection system and trap placement logic.</li>
  <li><strong>Network/Online Readiness:</strong> Integrated multiplayer functionality, ensuring smooth gameplay experiences for up to 4 players.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface and Player HUD:</strong> Designed and implemented the in-game user interface, including HUD elements that keep players informed of their keycard count and remaining time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The project demonstrates a strong understanding of game development processes, from concept to execution, and reflects the practical skills gained during my time at Vancouver Film School.
